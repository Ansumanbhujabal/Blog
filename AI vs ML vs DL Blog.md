The basics and differences to know before learning ML

We will try to understand each of these basics in a simple and easy to grasp way.

1.AI

Inter Disciplinary Branch of Computer Science which deals with building smart and intelligent machines.

Inter Disciplinary â€” Not limited to itâ€™s development and usage in a particular field or branch.

smart and intelligent machines â€” Machines that are capable of taking logical decisions on their own based on the input we provide to them.

example- Automated cars , self controlled jets

2.ML(Machine Learning)

Technique to implement AI that machine can learn from data by themselves without explicitly programmed for each and every case.

3.DL(Deep Learning)

Subfield of ML that uses Artificial Neural Network(ANN) to learn from data.

Types of ML
Machine Learning can be generally divided into three major types .They are Supervised , Unsupervised and Reinforced

Types Of ML Models
Their Differences lies in the procedures through which they are trained and processed.

To make it interesting adding an easy diagram made by me.

Conclusion
In conclusion, weâ€™ve ventured through the labyrinth of AI, ML, and DL, deciphering the alphabet soup of modern technology. Weâ€™ve demystified AI as the interdisciplinary wizardry behind our smart machines. ML, our trusty sidekick, is the technique that teaches our machines to learn from data, sparing us from micromanaging their every move. And last but not least, DL, the caped crusader of ML, wields the power of Artificial Neural Networks to take our machines to unprecedented heights.

But hey, this isnâ€™t the end of our journey. In the vast landscape of technology, thereâ€™s always more to explore, more acronyms to unravel, and more knowledge to gain. So, if you enjoyed this whirlwind tour of AI, ML, and DL, why not continue the adventure? Connect with me on LinkedIn for updates, insights, and maybe the occasional meme to brighten your day. And if youâ€™re feeling really ambitious, letâ€™s collaborate on GitHub and build the next generation of intelligent machines together. After all, who knows what other exciting acronyms await our exploration in the future? ðŸ˜‰ðŸ¤–
